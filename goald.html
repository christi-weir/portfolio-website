  <div class="col-md-8 col-lg-7">
  <p>Saving money can be difficult, but with the right tools and proper
encouragement it can be rather easy. This app is for users who are not
new to technology and who are planning to save before a big expense.
The user needs to be able to great a goal with a timeline and see all of
their financial information to see if they are on track.</p>

  <h1>Context</h1>
</div>
<div <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-7">
  <p>Psychologists have been using a method of goal setting for decades
that has proven to be elective. This method, known as SMART, is an
acronym for the types of goals that are most e!ective: Specific,
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely. By setting smaller
objectives under the mentioned goal types, users are more likely to
meet their saving goal. The app will use clean design, positive
psychology, encouraging writing to keep users engaged with meeting
their goals.</p>

  <h1>User Testing</h1>
  <h2>Introduction & Scenario</h2>
  <p> Good day,
Thank you for taking time to review my project. Please note that this test is in no way a test of your ability, it
is to measure the usability of the product. Try to spend no more than 5-10 minutes going through the
screens.
This is a money saving app that focuses on setting and accomplishing goals in an easy and fun way. The
screens you’ll be going through are the set-up screens new users will encounter. Imagine you are a new user
who just downloaded the app. You want to create a profile, so that the financial advice you receive is
personalized to you, your spending habits, and goals. Your task is to sign up with email, go through the
screens that collect information to make the app experience custom to your needs, and end on your
customized user dashboard.
Any and all constructive criticism is appreciated as it will help me make my design the best it can be.
Thank you!!
Christi</p>

<h2>User Feedback</h2>
<h3>Participant #1</h3>
  <p>Shelley, 31, Occupational Therapist
It looks pretty user friendly. I always like when I can use my email instead of link to Facebook. I like the graphs, budgets, and
spending analysis.</p>
  <h3>Participant #2</h3>
    <p>I was confused by the wording on the “Take Photo of Card”. Maybe change it a little? I like the use of badges, it makes it
feel like a game. But I’d like some more explanation on how the badges work. Is there somewhere I can go to see all my
badges? The dashboard has everything I need at a glance. I hate when I’m looking at my bank account and what I’m
spending is all over the place, the categories are a cool feature.</p>
    <h3>Participant #3</h3>
    <p>Sarah, 34, Accountant
It’d be cool to be able to pay your bills in there too. Maybe users can set reminders - electric usually comes out sound
the 25 so a notification would pop up to let you know that your Bill is coming soon and then maybe another when it’s
due. Also, as someone is saving to say “you have an extra $25 in your account, do you want to move this to savings to
reach your xyz goal sooner? But I think this is a great idea and I like the dashboard a lot.</p>

  <h1>Style Guide</h1>
      <h4>Logo</h4>
      <p>The logo is and bold, featuring a
gold coin against the blue
background.<p>

</div>
<div class=col-lg-5>
    <h4>Colors</h4>
    <p>The colors I have chosen are blue
which evokes feelings of loyalty
and trust, and orange which
evokes confidence and success.
The color choices will bring out
the main themes of the app,
success and security, which
highlight the user’s goal to grow
their savings. Secondary colors
will be used mainly for
illustrations and only in less
saturated values.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class=col-lg-5>
<h4>Typography</h4>
<p>I have chosen a rounded, sans-serif font to be the major font for titles and
headings.</p>
<p>Domus Regular - The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p>
<p>For body text, I chose a less round but still sans-serif font that looks clean and
modern.</p>
<p>Hero New - The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p>
</div>
<div class=col-lg-5>
<h4>Writing Style</h4>
<p>The writing will be positive, encouraging, and will evoke a feeling of security. Since
the app will focus on using psychology and the SMART method of goal setting, the
writing will also include tips for staying on track. Loading screens can feature quotes
or tips for effective goal success.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class=col-lg-12>
<h4>Image Style</h4>
<p>The app will not feature any photographs but will have illustrations that are
rounded and in the color theme. Images will be happy and encouraging. Icons will be
minimal yet rounded in design.</p>
